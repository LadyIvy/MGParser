CreateCall - creates references to calls


Inbound call steps:
  1. Call arrives from isdn line and "CreateCall" procedure will map it with a new reference ID:
       "CreateCall - Interface isdn-Bri2 create call 4-5."
       (4 refers to the isdn inbound call and 5 is assigned as id to the first internal routing pass)
       
  2. After call router has matched source for the the call with id 5 it will insert a new destination
     (hunt-group in my case) and add a new reference id to it: 6
        CallRouter [0624] Dst2/2=[CID:6 IID:hunt-Bri2
        
  3. When hunt group finds a specific interface where to send the call a new reference id will be created for it: 7
        CallRouter [0630] Dst2/2=[CID:7 IID:sip-bri0_1_0
        CallTable [0631] UseNextDestination - Call 4-7 use new destination sip-bri0_1_0.
        CallTable [0643] AddRefCall - Interface sip-bri0_1_0 add reference to call 7.
        
  4. At this point any event referred to ids from 4 to 7 is an event of the same call
